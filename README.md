# Social Network Model

Modeling real world social network interactivity using unweighted undirected graphs.

This project uses an adjacency matrix (like the one below) to represent the vertices and edges in the network. Each node in the graph is a unique user that can be linked to other users through the process of 'friending' common amongst most social networks. For information on specific methods and member variables, head over to the [Network API](/docs/network.md) doc.
